* Description
This layer provides an interface to the Slack chat service via the e-macs-slack
package. Where possible, this layer aims to reuse key bindings from the IRC
packages in Space-macs.

** Features:
- Real time messaging with [[https://github.com/ahyatt/e-macs-websocket][e-macs-websocket]]
- Connect to multiple slack instances
- Notifications with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert.el]]

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.space-macs=. You will need to
add =slack= to the existing =dotspace-macs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Configuration
Follow the instructions in the [[https://github.com/yuya373/e-macs-slack/blob/master/README.md][e-macs-slack]] package for obtaining your client ID,
client secret, and token.

To test that everything is alright put the following snippet in your
=dotspace-macs/user-config()= replacing =client-id=, =client-secret= and =token=
with your info.

*Important* Do not keep private data in your dotfile. You can put your private
stuff elsewhere (like Dropbox for instance) and load the file in your dotfile.

#+BEGIN_SRC e-macs-lisp
  (slack-register-team
    :name "e-macs-slack"
    :default t
    :client-id "my@email.address"
    :client-secret "mypassword"
    :token "token"
    :subscribed-channels '(general slackbot))
#+END_SRC

** Space-macs layout integration
A [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/space-macs/blob/develop/doc/DOCUMENTATION.org#layouts-and-workspaces][Space-macs custom layout]] is defined by the layer. The name and the key binding
for it can be customized with the following layer variables:
- =slack-space-macs-layout-name= for the layout name,
- =slack-space-macs-layout-binding= for the key binding.

By default the values are:

#+BEGIN_SRC e-macs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspace-macs-configuration-layers '(
    (slack :variables slack-space-macs-layout-name "@Slack"
                      slack-space-macs-layout-binding "s")))
#+END_SRC
