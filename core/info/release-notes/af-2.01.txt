             Space-macs at your fingertips... in your browser!

You are not dreaming, this is not an alien technology coming from the future.

                 Space-macs has been ported to the WEB!

Better than that, our technology flawlessly compiles e-macs Lisp on the fly to
Javascript thanks to the last version of our transpiler. Yes! This very same
transpiler which was capable to transpile e-macs Lisp to Vimscript, except Java
is better than Vim so we decided to go nuts and support the superior
Javascript.

Space-macs can benefit from all the candies provided by a WEB browser like being
able to run on any device supporting a decent browser, try it on your phone and
be amazed that even without any modifier you can still use e-macs thanks to the
'spacebar' and 'fd' or not...

Now Space-macs can really be like all the cool kids.
